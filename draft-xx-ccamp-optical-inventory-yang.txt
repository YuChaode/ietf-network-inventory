             Inventory YANG Data Model in Optical Networks
                draft-xx-ccamp-optical-inventory-yang-00

Abstract

   Network inventory is a foundamental functionality in network
   management and was specified many years ago.  Given the emerging of
   data model and their deployment in operator's management system, the
   traditional function is also requested to be defined as data model
   for inventory management.

   This document defines the YANG data model for optical network
   inventory information.  It augments the generic YANG model entities
   and can be used for resource management.

1.  Introduction

   Network inventory management and monitoring is a critical part of
   ensuring the network stays healthy, well-planned, and functioning in
   the carriers network.  Network inventory management allows the
   operator to keep track of what physical network devices are staying
   in the network including relevant software and hardware.

   The network inventory management also helps the operator to know when
   to acquire new assets and what is needed, or to decommission old
   ones, which can help improving network performance and capacity
   planning.

   TBD: review the related modules, depending on the augmentation
   relationship.  TBD: give the augmentation relationship.

2.  Terminologies

2.1.  Terms on Network Equipment

   TBD: Recap the concept of chassis/slot/component/board/... in TMF.

   Following terms are used for representation of the hierarchies in the
   optical network inventory.

   Network Element:

   Cabinet&#65306;a combination of rack, chassis and shelf.

   Chassis:

   Slot:

   Component:

   Board/Card:

2.2.  State of Network Equipment:

   Empty: no equipment is installed and no expected equipment has been
   identified;

   Installed & not expected: physically inserted in the NE but not
   expected;

   Expected & not Installed: expected but not currently installed;

   Installed & Expected: expected and currently installed;

   Mismatch of Installed & Expected: there is an inconsistency between
   the expected equipment and the installed equipment;

   Unavailable: this holder cannot accept the installation or
   provisioning of equipment (this is typically caused by a double width
   card installed next to this slot);

   Unknown: the state of the equipment are not known;

2.3.  Model Structure

   TBD: Top-down relationship from the above terms.
