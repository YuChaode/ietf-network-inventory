## Discussion

### Feedbacks from IETF 116

Discussion pointed out the need to work in the future on software inventory: Nigel can also provide some information about the work done in ONF core information model for software inventory

It has also been discussed the possibility to add a list of site and to structure it in a recursive manner (such as a site can contain other sites)

For example, a campus can be a site which contains buildings and a building can be another site which contains equipment rooms, and so on
