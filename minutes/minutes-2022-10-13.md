## Discussion

### Applicable attributes in RFC8348 (issue #17)

Jeff has provided a table to compare the attributes in RFC8348 with the attributes defined in OpenConfig and T-API: [Attributes_ Openconfig Jeff.xlsx](https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/files/9777563/Attributes_.Openconfig.Jeff.xlsx)

The list has been reviewed in detail during the call

Conclusions:
- all the attributes defined by OpenConfig which are applicable to network inventory are already supported by our model;
- all the attributes defined RFC8348 are required by network inventory with the exceptions of those defined for entity-mb, hardware-state and hardware-sensor features

### WG adoption request (issue #38)

> - [x] Chaode: send the mail to the CCAMP WG chairs cc-ing CCAMP WG, OPSAWG and Netmod WG mailing lists

Mail sent: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ccamp/k5aO56XJa4rITcLMAnrDHh-ff9s/

It seems that the plan for the chairs was to poll this document for WG adoption after the adoption of the OTN and optical path computation drafts (which have been just adopted as WG documents): https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ccamp/VTh9_GqCHVEExNOlzhfkPrN9jbs/

However, it is not clear whether the adoption poll will start before or after IETF 115.

If the draft is polled for WG adoption before IETF 115, we can keep the changes on hold until the draft is adopted as WG document. Otherwise we can submit an updated draft version to IETF 115 and request a presentation slot.
