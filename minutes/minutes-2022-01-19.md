## Discussion

### Integration efficiency issue

Slides from Chaode describing the issue and the alternative proposal from China Unicom to address the issue

Aihua (on slide 1): why fiber is at the same leve as NE?

Chaode: a fiber can be between two NEs so it does not belong to any NE. A fiber can be laydown between different equipment rooms so it does not belong to any equipment room

Aihua/Sergio: it is important to get feedbacks from those we are going to consume the network inventory information

We can track this issue on github to get further discussion

Italo: what is the relationship with issue #21

Chaode: this is an updated proposal, the proposal in issue #21 is different

Issue #32 create to track this issue

Slides uploaded on github: https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/files/7897916/Inventory.Model.Design_0119.pptx

We need more input about the integration scenarios with Orchestrator/OSS

Aihua: we are defining a network inventory at the NBI of a controller which oversees the whole network while the hardware model RFC 8348 is a device model so scalability is not an issue there

Chenfang: the current generic model cannot provide a good location information, such like ports, we need to find its parent and grandparent one step by one step

Aihua: component is a generic term. In order to get all the sub-slots an implementation needs to get the list of components shelves, then the list of components slots and then the list of sub-slots, while here different types of components are on different hierarchies
