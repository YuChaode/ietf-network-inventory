### Next calls

In order to facilitate more people to join the call, it has been proposed to move the call to another time. Two options have been considered:
1. swap the network inventory weekly calls with the flexi-grid weekly calls on thursday at 2pm CEST / 8am NA EDT / 8pm CST
2. postpone the call 1h later to 4pm CEST / 10am NA EDT / 10pm CST

- [ ] **Italo**: check with the participants of the network inventory weekly calls and of the flexi-grid weekly calls whether they are ok to swap the two slots (issue #80)

## Discussion

### Slides review (PR #79)

Slides for IETF 116 presentation reviewed and updated during the call

- [ ] **Chaode**: provide a slide to describe why not augmenting the network YANG model in RFC8345

### Relationship with ietf-topology (issue #75)

Agreed to close this issue since it is duplicated with issue #14

The comment provided by Oscar in this issue has been referenced in issue #14

### Proposal with schema-mount (issue #11)

Agreed to close this issue: no need to define any schema-mount with the current model and the model supporting the navigation between the network topology and the network hardware inventory models
