## Discussion

### Applicable attributes in RFC8348 (issue #17)

Need to add for each component the parent-rel-pos attribute defined in RFC8348 that could be used to know the position of the component within its parent component.

### Location/Position information (issue #3)

> - [ ] Aihua/Jeff/Sergio: provides a proposal for the location/position information, taking into account that it should be generic and not applicable only to optical NEs

The proposal for IETF 114 is to replace the location container with a free-form string:

OLD
```
                  +--ro location
                  |  +--ro equipment-room-name?   leafref
                  |  +--ro ne-name?               leafref
                  |  +--ro rack-number?           leafref
                  |  +--ro chassis-index?         uint16
                  |  +--ro slot-index?            uint16
                  |  +--ro port-index?            uint16
```
NEW
```
                  +--ro location                  string
```

The reason is that a free-form string has more flexibility than a pattern like "/ne=\<nw-ne-name>[/r=<r_index>][/sh=<sh_index>[/s_sh=<s_sh_index> 
…]][[/sl=<sl_index>[/s_sl=<s_sl_index> …]][/p=<p_index> …]]"  hich is common in optical networks but not sure it applies to any technology

The need to report the location information versus inferring it from the parent information (to updated with some index value) should be further discussed (e.g., during the presentation at IETF 114)
