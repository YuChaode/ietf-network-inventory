## Discussion

### Follow-up on previous discussions

#### Feedbacks from IETF 116

> Discussion pointed out the need to work in the future on software inventory: Nigel can also provide some information about the work done in ONF core information model for software inventory
> 

See open issue #64

> It has also been discussed the possibility to add a list of site and to structure it in a recursive manner (such as a site can contain other sites)
> 
> For example, a campus can be a site which contains buildings and a building can be another site which contains equipment rooms, and so on

To be discussed also considering the outcome of the discussion of issue #7

#### Management of NEs with multiple racks (issue #7)

https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-network-inventory/issues/7#issuecomment-1538479208

Slides reviewed and updated during the discussion: [multi-rack-NE-questions-02](https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-network-inventory/files/11451239/multi-rack-NE-questions-02.pptx)

The detailed changes to the model needs further discussion pending confirmation of the requirements to be addressed

- [ ] **Italo**: check with the operators if there are requirements to manage cases where the rack belongs to the NE and where the shelf does not belong to the NE
