## Discussion

### Review comments from Sergio and Jeff (issues #47 and #48)

Comments from both Sergio and Jeff have been merged into a single file and reviewed. Proposed resolutions embedded within this file [draft-yg3bp-ccamp-network-inventory-yang-01-sb-comments-jfb comments.docx](https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/files/9264067/draft-yg3bp-ccamp-network-inventory-yang-01-sb-comments-jfb.comments.docx).

The only pending comments (to be discussed in a future call) are:
- a comment from Jeff about the common attributes for the network elements;
- how to improve the last sentence in section 2.2
- what to do with section 2.2 since the scalability issues are outside the scope of this draft.

- [ ] **Chaode** : update the draft based on the comments resolutions agreed on 2022-08-04

### Plan for next steps

Considering the holiday period, weekly calls will restart from September 7 at 3pm CEST (9am NA EDT / 9pm CST)
