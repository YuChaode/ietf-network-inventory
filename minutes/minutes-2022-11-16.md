## Discussion

### Inventory models coordination #26

Issue #26 has been re-opened to track the inventory models coordination started during IETF 115

The feedback from IETF115 and the side meeting
- Robert Wilton agreed that itâ€™s a good idea to compare openconfig and our data model, and he suggested we could compare  the structure of these two model and we could have different terminologies.
- According to the side meeting, a new mailing list will be set up to coordinate different inventory drafts.

The material presented at the meeting is available at: https://github.com/billwuqin/Inventory-management-using-YANG

The Inventory YANG mailing list has been already setup:

https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/Inventory-yang

It is not yet clear whether we are going to be subscribed automatically or we should subscribe by our own. A question has been sent to the list administrator.

- [ ] **Italo**: provide feedbacks about the need to subscribe to the Inventory YANG mailing list

All the contributors to this draft are invited to join this list and actively contribute to the discussion

Our current view is that there is no overlapping between the scope of our draft, which is a network model for hardware inventory, and the scope of other drafts submitted to OPSAWG

As soon as the list is operational, we can share with the other participants the result of the analysis we have already done: https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/issues/26#issuecomment-996907583

This analysis is not covering [draft-wzwb-opsawg-network-inventory-management-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-wzwb-opsawg-network-inventory-management), which has been recently submitted

- [ ] **All**: Review [draft-wzwb-opsawg-network-inventory-management-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-wzwb-opsawg-network-inventory-management) to identify any potential overlapping with our draft

### Relationship between logical port and physical port #33

Reviewed the slides prepared by Chaode: https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/files/10028873/Solution.of.inventory.and.topology.travelling.pptx

The relationship between an inventory element (e.g., a NE) and a topological element (e.g., a node) is 1:n, with n>=1.
A NE can be associated with only one node, in case:
- the NE is a single-layer NE (e.g., a ROADM NE associated with a node within a L0 topology instance)
- the NE is a multi-layer NE associated with a multi-layer node (e.g., an OTN+WDM NE associated with a node within a multi-layer L0+OTN topology instance)
A NE can be associated with more than one node in case the NE is a multi-layer associated with multiple single-layer nodes (e.g., an OTN+WDM NE associated with a node within a L0 topology instance and with another node within the OTN topology instance)

Option 1 seems the preferred option among the participants.

The topology-id reference applies only to physical nodes, links and LTPs. When it is needed to know the NEs associated with an abstract node, the topology-id of the physical nodes in the underlay topology should be used instead.

The discussion will continue next week.

### Model traversal between inventory and topology (issue #31)

> Agreed that issue #31 is duplicated with #33: issue #31 has been closed and the comment in #31 referenced within #33
