No time to present the draft

Just a statement by the chair at the beginning claiming that the draft should stay in CCAMP WG

The feedback from the discussion is that the draft will progress in CCAMP WG and keep other interested WGs informed

Consider renaming the draft name and title.

- [ ] Italo: create a new issue in github

We can add some use cases to the draft keeping a placeholder for IP and MW use cases

- [ ] Chaode/Sergio: check for some IP use cases
- [ ] Jeff: check with other IP vendors for IP use cases
- [ ] Italo/Sergio: check for some MW use cases

More than one draft in CCAMP WG has raised the issue about using schema mount. The suggestion is to progress the work focusing on the information to be provided and, in parallel, to investigate how schema mount can be used.
