## Discussion

### Home WG for this draft ([issue #38](https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/issues/38))

The issue has been closed because the draft has been already adopted as CCAMP WG document: [draft-ietf-ccamp-network-inventory-yang-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-ccamp-network-inventory-yang-00)

### Need to find TMF reference for the equipment document SD2-20_EquipmentModel.pdf ([issue #40](https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/issues/40))

The issue has been closed because duplicated with issue #55

### Management of other component types (e.g., power supply units, fans) (issue #10)

We confirm the list of component types as defined in RFC8348. If there is a need to define new component types, they can be defined in the next versions of the I-D

The issue has been closed

### Management of NEs with multiple racks (issue #7)

- [ ] **Italo/Chaode**: Check whether these examples are already covered with the examples in #55

### Management of NEs with stacked shelf (issue #6)

- [ ] **Italo/Chaode**: Check whether these examples are already covered with the examples in #55

### Addressing comments during WG adoption (Draft PR #67)

The root container has to be renamed as "network-hardware-inventory" based on the clarified scope of the document

After that change, the draft PR would be ready for review

- [ ] **Chaode**: update the root container and start the PR review

- [ ] **Aihua/Jeff/Sergio**: review the PR once ready for review

### Bo WG adoption call comments (issue #60)

> 2) The draft states RFC 8345 recommends that network inventory should be augmentation to “ietf-network”, but there is no analysis on this. Can you add some description to this?
> 

Past discussion tracked in issue [#14](https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/issues/14)

There is a typo in the conclusion: the group has agreed NOT to augment RFC8345

It may worthwhile to add some text in the document to clarify the rationale for this choice

- [ ] **Chaode**: provide some initial text proposal

Agreed to re-open issue [#14](https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/issues/14) to track this discussion

### Structure for location/position information (issue #3)

Since the location is a free form string it would be worthwhile documenting some format constraints, similar to those defined in ONF TR-547, in the I-D

This is a common format used in Optical networks so it is recommended at least for Optical networks but it seems also applicable to IP and MW

This format can be described as a "recommended" format for Optical, IP and MW, unless there are objections from IP and MW experts

- [ ] **Chaode**: provide some text proposal to describe the recommended format of the location string

### Rack attributes (issue #68)

This information needs to be stored within the OSS but, according to Fabio, it is configured manually in the OSS and not discovered by the underlay controllers

- [ ] Jeff: further investigate internally
- [ ] Chaode: further investigate with Chenfang

### Geolocation information (issue #62)

Jeff: we have a requirement for the SDN controller to provide a GUI to report the GIS (geolocation information system) of the NEs

Agreed to:
- rename the "location" attribute as "room-location" and keep it optional to report the equipment-room postal address;
- add a geolocation container for the GIS and defined it as optional

Therefore there is complete freedom to report only the postal address or the GIS or both

Two options to analyze:
a) use the groupings defined in [RFC9179](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9179)
b) use the geolocation-container grouping defined in [RFC8795](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8795)

To be further discussed
