### Location/Position information (issue #3)

> - [ ] Aihua/Jeff/Sergio: provides a proposal for the location/position information, taking into account that it should be generic and not applicable only to optical NEs

Feedbacks from Sergio on github:
> OpenConfig has a string position but it seems to exploit on parent and child pointer (leafref) to show the structure of all the components in the node and a the containments.
