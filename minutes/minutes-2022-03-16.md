It is also possible to find an alternative solution (e.g., throuhg a file) to retrieve huge amount of data

It is not clear whether the full synchronization is needed only once (at the beginning of a session) or multiple times

Concerns have been raised about the fact that in large scale networks notifications are not fully reliable so it is not possible to rely on them after an initial synchronization

Further investigation about the notification issue is needed

Jeff: an alternative solution (e.g., based on a file) is acceptable if it is used at the beginning of the session and the rest can be managed through notifications

Full synchronization using RESTCONF can require a lot of time

T-API Streaming (ONF TR-458) is a mechanism defined in ONF to resolve some of the efficiency issues with RESTCONF base notifications and it applies to any type of notification (not only to telemetry data). It also allows re-synchronization after the communication between client and server has been lost

- [ ] Further investigate the issues with RESTCONF notifications and the alternative solutions (e.g., streaming) defined in IETF (issue #37)

### Integration efficiency issue (issue #32)

> - [ ] Jeff/Anton will check internally about scalability and report to all the feedback.

### Sub-shelf and sub-slot modelling

> - [ ] Sergio: check with Andrea how we can reference the TMF document 

> - [ ] Chaode: Provide some textual description and a slice of this example which do not depend on whether to choose CU proposal or current YANG model

> - [x] Chaode: Upload the two JSON examples on two different branches on github
