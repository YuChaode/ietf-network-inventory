## Discussion

### Integration efficiency issue (issue #32)


Reviewed slides: https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/files/7897916/Inventory.Model.Design_0119.pptx

The proposed model is applicable also to IP

Aihua: When the system is getting big, there would be scalability problems. Most of the YANG data models are currently running on a single NE or on a small network environment with not so much data as in big networks

Jeff: I am not sure we need the equipment room information in the MDSC

Chaode: all the racks are in the equipment room so we can have some default values for the equipment rooms. Dr Zheng from CU has a special use for the equipment room

Italo: with the CU proposal we can keep the equipment-room optional: if not implemented, the racks will not be pointed by any equipment room. So we can still keep the equipment-room as an optional and use the YANG feature to indicate whether this option is supported or not by the server

Chaode: the fiber does not belong to any NE so it should be at the same level as NE

Italo: if we follow the same logic as per equipment-room, also the fiber object can be kept as optional

Jeff: when you retrieve a board in a NE, is there a way to know in which slot this boards is located?

Chaode: we have a location attribute in the board which reports in which equipment-room, rack, shelf, slot/sub-slot the board is located

- [ ] Italo: send a mail to the co-authors soliciting investigation and feedbacks before next week call

Chaode: I have investigated within Huawei and this model is applicable to IP, optical and also MW equipment

Jeff: we have investigated about the stack of two chassis and it is no more quite common in IP

Chaode: what about not differentiating between shelf and sub-shelf and just provide an attribute indicating whether it is a sub-shelf

Aihua: not sure if IP and DCI worlds would use the term shelf

Jeff: shelf is only for optical, IP usually uses the terms chassis

Agreement: rename the shelf as chassis which is a more generic term and explain that in optical networks it is also called shelf

Italo: what about the relationship between a shelf and its contained sub-shelves?

We need to identify also the list of sub-shelves contained by a shelf

Chaode: in TMF there a figure showing the appearance for each objects and we can reference this figure to avoid any ambiguity
