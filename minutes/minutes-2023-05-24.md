## Discussion

### Inventory models coordination (issue #26)

Reviewed the latest version of proposed charter: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/inventory-yang/GcBEYEnG07JZHL1mPTT994N8B6I/

Comments:
- D: multi-layer is not a proper name for inventory objects. Better to use the term layer-independent or layer-agnostic for inventory
- E: correlation might be understood as implying some complex processing, better to use relationship instead

- [ ] **Nigel**: raise the comment on the Inventory mailing list

There is a lot of potential complexity when dealing with planning of components and may be worthwhile understanding what should be covered by the inventory model

Jeff/Fabio: at least it could be important to mark an holder as reserved (e.g., because a new board is planned to be deployed there)

Issue #82 created to track the discussion on this topic

### Management of NEs with multiple racks (issue #7)

> - [x] **Italo**: check with the operators if there are requirements to manage cases where the rack belongs to the NE and where the shelf does not belong to the NE
> 

Jeff: for me the rack is not part of the NE but the NE can be spread over multiple racks

Nigel: I have see a variety of equipment types

The difference between the left and right figures in slide 2 of [multi-rack-NE-questions-02](https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-network-inventory/files/11451239/multi-rack-NE-questions-02.pptx) is that in the right figure the NE owns the rack and it is aware of the rack while on the left figure the NE is not aware of the fact that its shelves are located on the same rack

Fabio: in the cases where the rack belongs to the NE, the rack contains only one shelf and not multiple shelves

Nigel: better not to restrict the model and define a list which can have only one element

Phil: sometimes in a multi-chassis system there is a logical rack identifier which is arbitrary and not related with the physical rack location

As a consequence the "r=1" string in the location string does not necessarily mean that the rack belongs to the NE but it may mean that the shelf is associated with a logical rack. This 'rack' actually correspond with the component ```stack``` in RFC8348 which can be either a physical or a logical grouping of chassis.

**Conclusion**: no need to have an association between the rack physical element and the stack NE component of a network-element. The association can still be kept between the shelf physical element and the chassis NE component as in the current model.

Slides updated based on the feedbacks of this call: [multi-rack-NE-questions-03.pptx](https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-network-inventory/files/11568147/multi-rack-NE-questions-03.pptx)

Need to further discuss:
- the case of a single-board NE (when the chassis does not belong a a NE)
- the case of a pizza box which may or may not be located on a rack
