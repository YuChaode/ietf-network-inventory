### Integration efficiency issue (issue #32)

> - [x] Aihua: check if there are some export mechanisms in OpenConfig

There is no definition for official export mechanisms but in the fields there are RPCs implemented to export e.g., the fault log

Question: should we define an export mechanisms within the Inventory draft or define a more generic mechanism applicable to the Inventory or other models in a separated draft?

Chaode has suggested to collect as many requirements as possible, especially from operators' perspective, to know what kind of functions operator want to use from inventory. So that we can try to provide these functions by these two modules. It will help to judge which model is easier for integration.

Reviewed slides from Chaode on requirements: [Requirements of Inventory.pptx](https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/files/8472047/Requirements.of.Inventory.pptx)

> - [ ] Everybody: prepare a list of pros&cons of the different modelling approaches for review during next week

> - [ ] Jeff/Anton will check internally about scalability and report to all the feedback.

> - [ ] Jeff: to check with Anton whether the flat modelling can simplify the mapping to the internal database structure
