## Discussion

The target is to have a -00 draft to present at IETF 112

Target to resolve issues #6, #7, #8, #9 and #12 for the -00 draft submission at IETF 112. A milestone has been added for these issues.

### High-level proposals

Three options proposed on github:
1. Initial straw-man proposal: [issue #1-comment](https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/issues/1#issue-924723063)
1. Proposal based on RFC8348: [issue #2-comment](https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/issues/2#issuecomment-903086514)
1. Proposal based on schema-mount [issue #11-comment](https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/issues/11#issue-1011938284)

General agreement to start from RFC8348 as the basis either by re-using it (option 2) or with schema-mount (option 3). The decision between option 2 and 3 is pending furhter analysis of the schema mount mechanism.

Issue #1 can be closed.

### Schema mount (issue #11)

Oscar: Mounting would take our task easier since we can monut the RFC8348 and get everything

Oscar: In the device model there are state data but do not know whether this data is needed for the inventory

Italo: is it possible not to mount everything?

Oscar: we need to chec

Aihua: could we mount a sub-tree instead of the whole container?

Oscar: to be further checked

- [ ] **Oscar**: check these issues and provide some examples of how schema mount has been used

### Scope of the model (issue #4)

Oscar/Jeff B./Victor thinks that the network inventory model should be technology-agnostic and applicable to at least Optical and IP

Aihua: in order to understand the applicability to IP, we need to investigate which objects are of interest to the inventory for IP networks

Let's define an high-level structure and then investigate that it could support IP networks as well

Which WG should the draft be targeted?

* CCAMP: applicability to Optical as well as WG which has more LS relationship (like the Alarm Management)
* TEAS: originate from a gap in the ACTN POI analysis
* Netmod: the origin of RFC8348

General agreement to submit the initial draft to CCAMP WG

### Management of equipment rooms and racks (issue #8)

Italo asked if equipment rooms and racks information should be part or not of the model, since these info are not part of the node as shelf, boards etc .

Oscar: the inventory system has this information but it is not needed for the network inventory retrieved at the NBI of a controller since this information should be added manually anyway

Fabio: in TIM we are using the equipment rooms and racks to identify the equipment otherwise it is not easy to identify them

Oscar: the issue is whether this information should be provided by the controller or by a separated entity, but it might be an operator-specific decision

Fabio asked if these information about equipment room and racks could be "optional" in the model.

- [ ] Aihua/Italo: check if it is possible to support equipment-room and racks as an option

### Where to put the component list (issue #9)

Jeff the master of the model should the "node" and related information.

Fabio: the network is quite big so you can get a lot of components within the network. If the component list is placed under the node it will smaller

Aihua: the issue may be due to the implementation efficiency

Need to get further investigation from the vendors if there are performance penalties with a model where the component list is defined under the network instead of under the node

### Management of NEs with stacked shelf (issue #6)

It is not yet clear if there is such a requirement. However, it seems that RFC8348 allows managing NEs with stacked shelves

- [ ] **Aihua**: Check how RFC8348 supports NEs with stacked shelves

### Management of NEs with multiple racks (issue #7)

The requiment to support NEs with multiple racks has been confirmed

There is also a requirement to support NEs with multiple shelves on different racks

The example in github seems not correct: to be reviewed and fixed

- [ ] **Aihua/Italo**: Check how to support NEs with multiple racks as well as NEs with multiple shelves on different racks and fix the example
