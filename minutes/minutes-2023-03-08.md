To be closed with PR #72

### Tom Petch WG adoption poll comments (issue #58)

> lots of string with no constraint; given the prior art in SMI perhaps constraints similar to those of SMI would be appropriate.
> 

Agreed reply:

> discussion on the CCAMP and Netmod WG mailing lists has indicated that some people have concerns but only when unconstrained strings are used as keys. The model is not using any unconstrained strings as keys, so no need to change.

- [ ] **Chaode**: reply to the mail from Tom after uploading the -01 revision
