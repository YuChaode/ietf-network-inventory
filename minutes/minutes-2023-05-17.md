## Discussion

### Proposal with schema-mount (issue #11)

Already discussed and agreed to close the issue

### Add timestamp to know when a component information was retrived (issue #73)

Need to clarify the meaning of the timestamp: whether it is the last time the information has been validated or whether it is the last time the information has been updated (changed) or both

We can define two optional timestamps to allow implementation freedom

Need to define whether these timestamps are defined per component or per device: it is possible to put the integrity timestamp at the device level and the change timestamp on a component level

Need to clarify that these timestamps are not intended to be used for assurance but only for planning, installation or to verify upgrades in the network

Chaode: what about adding a command to request the controller to refresh the information?

A refresh action can be added to the model

The integrity timestamp is also needed for the "non-detectable" information for equipment-room, rack and device: in this case the refresh action is not applicable

Need to clarify better the use cases

- [ ] **Oscar/Fabio/Jeff**: Provide more information about the use cases

### Use node-id instead of uuid for indexing elements (issue #74)

It was clarified the issue applies to the identification of the network element and not to the identification of the components

Using the node-id, which is an URI, allows also using UUID to identify NEs but allows other types of identification

Chaode has raised concerns with using the node-id to correlate a node in the topology model with a NE in the inventory model in case of multi-layer NE

Need to continue the discussion next week
