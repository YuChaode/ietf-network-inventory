## Discussion

### Schema Mount (issue #11)

Aihua: schema mount allows mounting any network inventory model. If our intention is to develop a standard inventory model, schema mount might not be the right option

Jeff: a possibility could be to have a generic fixed schema which where technology-specific information can be mounted. Maybe just doing a schema mount might not be sufficient to justify a new draft

Agreement to focus on defining a common generic model and then evaluate later the need to add some mount points to add additional information

### Management of NEs with stacked shelf (issue #6)

Feedbacks from Netmod WG to Aihua question:

https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/netmod/GSesWMmFyhxBz56UqL0GojgtEoE/

Jeff: a stack is typically a set of chassis which are managed as a single network element: these chassis are without redundant  control board but control board redundancy is achieved by having different chassis with control boards

Aihua: this looks like a shelf/sub-shelf configuration in optical NEs. The difference is that the main shelf has redundant control boards while the sub-shelves do not have control boards

Fabio: in TIM, when we stack two chassis we usually model them as two NEs. Sometimes it is managed as a single NE with two shelves

Jeff: there are also solutions where you can stack pizza boxes and manage them as a single node

- [ ] Jeff/Fabio: further investigate the use case of stacked NEs
