## Discussion

### TMF document reference

> - [x] Sergio: check with Andrea how we can reference the TMF document 

See issue #39

- [ ] Italo/Sergio: propose text for the reference to be added to the I-D and check with Andrea for comments

### Integration efficiency issue (issue #32)

> Question: should we define an export mechanisms within the Inventory draft or define a more generic mechanism applicable to the Inventory or other models in a separated draft?

Jeff: our draft should focus only on the YANG model. The other issue is much bigger problem to tackle which requires discussion with other WGs (e.g., Netmod, Netconf)

Aihua: the scalability issue seems quite generic to justify a generic solution. The question is whether we need a network inventory specific RPC or do we leave it to the implementor to implement

Italo: I think the answer depends on the generic solution: if it can be used as it is to retrieve the inventory, there is no need for inventory specific RPC

Jeff: it is not fully clear what is the limit between the data model and the RESTCONF interface for the scalability issue

The focus is to decide the modelling approach and identify which elements are generic and which are technology-specific

> - [ ] Everybody: prepare a list of pros&cons of the different modelling approaches for review during next week

> - [x] Jeff/Anton will check internally about scalability and report to all the feedback.

> - [x] Jeff: to check with Anton whether the flat modelling can simplify the mapping to the internal database structure

- [ ] Anton: check internally about scalability and report to all the feedback
