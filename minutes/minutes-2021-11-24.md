### Review of current YANG model

Anton: with the current model there is no way to traverse from the topology to the inventory data model

Issue about the fact that the topology model can be abstract with no one-to-one relationship with the physical components in the inventory

Anton: a possible solution could be to expose an abstract topology and a physical topology and associate the latter with the inventory

Jeff: operators' requirements at the HCO level is to have a full view of the network

Victor: it depends on whether you wish to manage everything at the hierarchical controller, but there are cases where it is sufficient for the hierarchical controller to work on an abstract topology

- [ ] Anton: create a new issue in github (issue #31)

### IP and MW use cases (issues #28 and #29)

Anton: there are implementation that allows multiple devices to be managed as a single NE with satellite devices: it would be simpler to manage all the individual devices as separated nodes

Chaode: IP have different inventory objects such as slicing information (a slice-id reference for each inventory object)

Anton: slicing is a generic term and hardware slicing could in principle be possible but this should not be in our scope. People can develop some augmentations of our model if hardware slicing becomese a requirement.

Agreement not to address hardware slicing in this version of the model: hardware slicing can be done either by an augmentation or by a future revision of the YANG model

Jeff: TIP is working on the design of Distributed Disaggregated Backbone router (DDBR), so it would be good to validate the current network inventory model to support also this use case

- [ ] Victor: check for the DDBR use cases (issue #30)

### Schema Mount (issue #11)

- [ ] Victor: to present some ideas at the next call about how schema mount could be used
