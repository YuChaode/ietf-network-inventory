## Discussion

### TMF document reference (issue #39)

> - [x] Italo/Sergio: propose text for the reference to be added to the I-D and check with Andrea for comments

Proposal submitted to github:

> [TMF_SD2-20] TM Forum, "SD2-20_Equipment Model", TMF MTOSI 4.0, Network Resource Fulfilment (NRF), SD2-20, May 2008, <https://www.tmforum.org/resources/suite/mtosi-4-0>

Proposal agreed

### Integration efficiency issue (issue #32)

#### Feedbacks about this issue

> - [x] Anton: check internally about scalability and report to all the feedback

It seems that the flat model is more suitable for bigger scale and it assumes that the client will do the resolution of the references

However, there is no quantitative information about the network size that would cause an issue with the generic model

The flat model is also easier to map with the internal structure for most implementations since it maps with the internal tables

The client need to resolve the references and the complexity would depend on the client implementation

Flat model is like a puzzle: you have all the pieces but you need to re-create reference among them .
From this point hirarchical model is by default structured.

Chenfang: in CU there are at least tens of thousand NEs within one domain. The super-controllr should manage more than 30 provinces

#### Requirements

Continued to review the slides from Chaode on requirements: [Requirements of Inventory.pptx](https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/files/8472047/Requirements.of.Inventory.pptx)

Some specific RPCs may need to be defined in the YANG model to support some of the required queries. However, it is better to identify the most common requirements not to define RPCs for any possible requirement.
