Chengfang: the port and the transceiver are not the same

Jeff: they have a transceiver plugged into a daughter board or in a board and the port is where the fiber is plugged-in

Need to clarify the definition of port: hardware inventory is concern only with the physical ports (entities where the fibers are plugged-in) and not with logical ports (e.g., VLANs, LAGs)

Need to clarify the relationship between logical port and physical port: new open issue #33

In inventory model you have physical port (entities where the fibers are plugged-in), but in the topology you can also have physical ports (for example low level of LTP in RFC8795) and logical ports. The former can be associated with the physical ports in the network inventory bridging between the two models

Need more details on the MPO ports (also considering different possible configurations) and evaluate how to model them within the hardware network inventory: new open issue #34

Need to better understand the problem of scalability that is the base of the proposed model by China Unicom.

- [ ] Jeff/Anton will check internally about scalability and report to all the feedback.
