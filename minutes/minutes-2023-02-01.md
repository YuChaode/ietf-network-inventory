## Discussion

### Addressing comments during WG adoption (PR #67)

PR #66 has been closed (github issue). The changes are provided in the new PR #67

The updates in the PR are aligned with the discussion from last meeting

Note that the filenames for YANG code and tree have been changed so the changes cannot be tracked using github.

Therefore, the old files have been kept in order to allow tracking the changes with other tools by comparing the old and new files.

### Number of authors (RFC7322) (issue #59)

> - [x] **Chaode/Sergio**: check with the CCAMP WG chairs whether this requirement should be fixed before WG adoption or before WG LC

For the time being, we will have three authors in the front page:
- Chaode
- Sergio or Victor
- Jeff

- [ ] Sergio/Victor: decide which one will be in the front page

All the other co-authors will be moved in the contributors section

### Inventory models coordination (issue #26)

> - [x] **All**: Review [draft-wzwb-opsawg-network-inventory-management-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-wzwb-opsawg-network-inventory-management) to identify any potential overlapping with our draft

Reviewed the slides provided by Chaode: https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/files/10555598/Analysis.of.Enterprise.Network.Inventory.Draft.pptx

One possibility could be that the enterprise network inventory augments this model with:
- new hardware component types and component-specific attributes
- softward inventory

Bo mentioned some comments on the enterprise network inventory requesting to combine hardware and software inventory in a single component list

Italo expressed some doubts since there are some attributes which are common to different hardware components but not applicable to software components and vice-versa there are some attributes which are common to different software components but not applicable to hardware components

Further discussion is needed since collapsing hardware and software management in a single component list may have an impact on the current YANG model design
