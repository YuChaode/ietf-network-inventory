## Discussion

### Preparation for IETF 113

> - [x] Italo/Chaode: prepare a text proposal for the updated draft
> - [x] Sergio/Jeff/Aihua: to review the text proposal once available

Updated draft uploaded to IETF: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-yg3bp-ccamp-network-inventory-yang/

Updated draft reviewed during the call and some text changes agreed

- [ ] Chaode: upload the updated draft on github

> Proposal is to present this issue in the context of this draft in CCAMP WG and send also e-mails about the general scalability issues to Netmod and TEAS WGs referencing this draft and the presentation in CCAMP WG

> - [x] Chaode: request CCAMP WG chairs a slot for presentation

Slot has been requested

Chaode has presented an initial draft of the slides

The slides have been reviewed and updated during the call

- [ ] Chaode: distribute the updated slides

- [ ] Chaode: send a mail about the scalability issue to CCAMP, Netmod and TEAS WGs

### Integration efficiency issue (issue #32)

> - [ ] Jeff/Anton will check internally about scalability and report to all the feedback.

### Sub-shelf and sub-slot modelling

> - [ ] Sergio: check with Andrea how we can reference the TMF document

Chaode has presented some JSON examples using the CU proposal and using the current model

The CU proposal looks easier to understand

It has been agreed to add some child/parent pointers to the CU proposal to simplify the navigation in both directions. Just need to be careful with the YANG language constraints with leafref (to be checked)

It has been agreed to collect some possible requirements could be raised while doing the integration. For example, full retrieval or a NE synchronization, or to discover the whole boards in network, etc. Then we can check how can these two models provide their interfaces to judge which model will be more applicable

- [ ] Chaode: Provide some textual description and a slice of this example which do not depend on whether to choose CU proposal or current YANG model
- [ ] Chaode: Upload the two JSON examples on two different branches on github
