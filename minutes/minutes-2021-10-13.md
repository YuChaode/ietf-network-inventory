## Discussion

The target is to have a -00 draft to present at IETF 112

Target to resolve issues #6, #7, #8, #9 and #12 for the -00 draft submission at IETF 112. A milestone has been added for these issues.

### Management of NEs with stacked shelf (issue #6)

Jeff: in IP case it is a requirement (e.g., leaf and spine architecture) but also in Optical you can have a Transponder shelf connected to a slave shelf and itself connected to a master shelf

Aihua: RFC8348 does not define sub-shelves

Italo: the sub-shelf can be seen as a chassis contained within a parent chassis

There is some ambiguity within RFC8348 definitions about whether a chassis can contain another chassis as well as whether a stack can contain another stack

- [ ] **Aihua**: check with Netmod WG
- [ ] **Jeff**: provide some examples to be analysed further

This issue is no longer required to be closed by IETF 112

### Management of NEs with multiple racks (issue #7)

In the RFC8348 there is no rack component type. The stack is a logical combination of multiple shelves in the same or different racks.

Jeff: could be interested to have some examples to understand what they had in mind

There is some confusion between the stack and the rack definition

General rules when rack and shelves are reported:

* The NEs are modelled with one root component of type stack (which represents the group of chassis within th NE) which contains contains children components of type stack (which represents the racks within the NE).

* The racks are modelled as a component of type stack (which represents the group of chassis within the rack) which contains children components of type chassis (which are shelves).

Updated example:

```
components
  - network-element
    class: stack
    // position: ne-name
    children:
    - rack-1
    - rack-2
  - rack-1
    class: stack
    parent: network-element
    parent-position: 1
    // position: ne-name/r=1
    children:
    - shelf-1-1
    - shelf-1-2
  - shelf-1-1
    class: chassis
    parent: rack-1
    parent-position: 1
    // position: ne-name/r=1/sh=1
  - shelf-1-2
    class: chassis
    parent: rack-1
    parent-position: 2
    // position: ne-name/r=1/sh=2
  - rack-2
    class: stack
    parent: network-element
    parent-position: 2
    // position: ne-name/r=2
    children:
    - shelf-2-1
  - shelf-2-1
    class: chassis
    parent: rack-2
    parent-position: 1
    // position: ne-name/r=2/sh=1
```

Note: based on the general rule, the example of issue #6 could be updated as follow, when reporting rack and shelf:

```
components
  - network-element
    class: stack
    // position: ne-name
    children:
    - rack-1
  - rack-1
    class: stack
    parent: network-element
    parent-position: 1
    // position: ne-name/r=1
    children:
    - shelf-1
  - shelf-1
    class: chassis
    parent: rack-1
    parent-position: 1
    // position: ne-name/r=1/sh=1
    children:
    - sub-shelf-1-1
    - sub-shelf-1-2
    - sub-shelf-1-3
  - sub-shelf-1-1
    class: chassis
    parent: shelf-1
    parent-position: 1
    // position: ne-name/r=1/sh=1/s_sh=1
  - sub-shelf-1-2
    class: chassis
    parent: shelf-1
    parent-position: 2
    // position: ne-name/r=1/sh=1/s_sh=2
    children:
    - sub-shelf-1-2-1
  - sub-shelf-1-2-1
    class: chassis
    parent: sub-shelf-1-2
    parent-position: 1
    // position: ne-name/r=1/sh=1/s_sh=2/s_sh=1
  - sub-shelf-1-3
    class: chassis
    parent: shelf-1
    parent-position: 3
    // position: ne-name/r=1/sh=1/s_sh=3
```

It has been noted that reporting the rack (as well as the shelf contained in it) number in this case is optional. An alternative approach is to report directly starting from the shelf-1 as the root:

```
components
  - shelf-1
    class: chassis
    // position: ne-name
    children:
    - sub-shelf-1-1
    - sub-shelf-1-2
    - sub-shelf-1-3
  - sub-shelf-1-1
    class: chassis
    parent: shelf-1
    parent-position: 1
    // position: ne-name/s_sh=1
  - sub-shelf-1-2
    class: chassis
    parent: shelf-1
    parent-position: 2
    // position: ne-name/s_sh=2
    children:
    - sub-shelf-1-2-1
  - sub-shelf-1-2-1
    class: chassis
    parent: sub-shelf-1-2
    parent-position: 1
    // position: ne-name/s_sh=2/s_sh=1
  - sub-shelf-1-3
    class: chassis
    parent: shelf-1
    parent-position: 3
    // position: ne-name/s_sh=3
```

### Management of equipment rooms and racks (issue #8)

The general approach is agreed to keep equipment-room as an optional list

Fabio: in addition to equipment-room and racks, we need the rows/lines

To be further discussed whether to put the rows/lines within the model or in the rack naming convention

### Scope of uniqueness for the rack-id (issue #16)

It has been clarified that, when present, the numbering of the rack is within the scope of the NE (i.e., ne-name/r=1 is the first rack of a given NE). For this reason, the rack can be omitted when all the shelves of the NE are within one rack, as in the example above.

The exact location of the rack/shelf is provided within the equipment-room list (see issue #8)

Example:

```
equipment-room
- room-1
  rack
  - rack-3-10 (rack 10 in line 3)
    shelf
    - shelf-5
      chassis-ref: ne-1/shelf
    - shelf-6
      chassis-ref: ne-2/shelf

node
- ne-1
  component
  - shelf
    // position: ne-1-name
    children:
    - board-1
    - board-2
    - board-3
- ne-2
  component
  - shelf
    // position: ne-2-name
    children:
    - board-1
    - board-2
    - board-3
```

### Where to put the component list (issue #9)

Jeff: OSS people prefer to have the list of component under the node and not under the network

Agreement to define the component list under the node for the -00 and to keep the option open for further discussion/investigation

### Motivation for the draft (issue #12)

Jeff has proposed some text: to be reviewed offline before next week call

### Should network inventory augment RFC8345 network or define a new root? (issue #14)

Jeff: today proprietary APIs are following option 2. However, we need also to be able to correlate the topology information with the inventory information.

Sergio: to be checked if using filters would solve the issue

Agreement to follow option 2 for the -00 and to keep the option open for further discussion/investigation

### Relationship with RFC8348 (issue #2)

For the -00 draft we can target an high-level structure with equipment-room and component lists and relationships, copying from RFC8348

A solution based on schema mount can be evaluated for a future update

Detailed list attributes can be added later.

### Evaluate whether all the attributes defined in RFC8348 needs to be reported in the Inventory model (issue #17)

Jeff: the operational state is needed, not the other states

To be further discussed after IETF 112

### Management of other component types (e.g., power supply units, fans) (issue #10)

Jeff: power supply and fan are required. To further investigate if other component types need to be supported.

### Initial draft authors (issue #20)

Need to decide who is going to co-sign the draft

- [ ] Italo: send mail requesting who is co-signing the -00 draft
