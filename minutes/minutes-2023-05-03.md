## TAPI Inventory (Nigel)

Slides from Nigel: [models-relationship-00.pptx](https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-network-inventory/files/11419154/models-relationship-00.pptx)

Clarified that a strand is a physical indivisible element which can be spliced or connected to other strands to form a physical span: see examples in slide 6
